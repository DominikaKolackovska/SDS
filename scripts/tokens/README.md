# SDS Token Generator

This script converts all styles and variables into a theme css file with CSS custom properties. You must be on enterprise to run this through the REST API. If you are not, you can use these plugins to get the data for styles.json and tokens.json and then you can run the converter separately with the `--skip-rest-api` flag.
