# figma-pluin-component-preview

This is a proof of concept for rendering self-hosted storybook instances inside of Figma.

In this directory, there is a Figma storybook file that contains stories that map Figma props to Storybook params. This plugin attempts to render those stories in the Figma plugin iframe.
